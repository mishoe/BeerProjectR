Maris Otter Pale Malt with the other malted grains listed above in 6.5 quarts of water heated to a strike temperature of 175&deg;F. The mash should then stabilize at a temperature of about 155&deg;F. Knock it down 3 degrees if you want more fermentables. Hold at that temperature for 45 minutes then strain and sparge the grains and collect the wort. (If you can&#39;t boil a total volume of 6.5 gallons, boil it in a total boil volume of 3 gallons and after collecting the wort, top off the fermenter with room temperature water to a final volume of 5 gallons. Boiling a smaller volume in a smaller pot will allow you to cool the wort at the end of the process without using a wort chiller. Just place the boil pot into a sink of cold water and change out the water as it heats up. That will cool the wort temperature a little more slowly than using a wort chiller but it will get the job done. Just monitor the wort temperature with a sanitized thermometer.). I also only start the boil using a portion of the liquid malt extract (say 1 lb. of it). I then add the remaining liquid extract at the end of the 60 minute boil and waiting 10 minutes to sanitize it. To take a hydrometer reading to determine the Original Gravity (O.G.) of the wort, extract a sample of the wort with a sanitized Fermtech wine/beer thief (19&rdquo; long) and I insert the hydrometer in it to measure the gravity instead of pouring the wort sample into a hydrometer jar. After measuring the gravity, dispose of the sample to prevent contamination of the batch. I also use a Fermtech Auto-Siphon to rack or transfer liquids from one container (fermenter) to another or during bottling (to which I attach a bottle filler). It&#39;s easier to use than a racking cane to rack the liquids. Follow this and you will have a premium chocolate porter to drink and to experiment with in future batches.

Put all crushed grains into a steeping bag and tie the end into a knot to close it. Place the grain filled bag into the brew pot water and heat to approximately 160170 °F (7177 °C). Do not boil the grains. Carefully remove the grain bag and allow it to drain into the brew pot without squeezing. Discard the grain-filled bag.<br/> <br/> 3. Heat the brew pot water to boiling. Remove kettle from heat. Add malt extract syrup and dry malt extract. Stir well and return to heat. Stir constantly until it returns to a boil. Add bittering hops. Be careful not to let the pot boil over. Do not use the kettle lid. Boil for 55 minutes, stirring occasionally, and then add finishing hops. Boil for an additional 5 minutes (total boiling time is 60 minutes).<br/> <br/> 4. Cool the wort rapidly to 70 °F (21 °C). Pour the brew pot contents into a sanitized 6.5-gallon (24.7-L) fermenter. Adhering a liquid crystal thermometer to the outside of the fermenter can monitor temperature.<br/> <br/> 5. With the cooled wort in the fermenter, add cold water (70 °F/21 °C) until the level reaches the 5-gallon (19-L) mark on the bucket. Sanitize a hydrometer and take the original gravity (OG) reading. Be sure to record this number for future reference.<br/> <br/> 6. Sprinkle the yeast on top of the wort and stir well. Insert the sanitized airlock into the sanitized lid. Secure the lid on the fermenter with the airlock in place (approximately half filled with clean water).<br/> <br/> 7. Place the fermenter in a warm area to maintain a temperature of 6872 °F (2022 °C). Keep the fermenter away from sunlight and fluorescent lights. You should notice bubbling in the airlock within 24 hours. Bubbling will slow down significantly after one or two days and then stop completely after 710 days. When bubbling has stopped completely prepare for bottling or optional secondary fermentation.<br/> *Optional  a process called secondary (or two-stage) fermentation may be used to improve beer clarity and to remove sediment. After primary fermentation completes, siphon the beer into a 5-gallon (19-L) glass carboy, attach the airlock via a rubber stopper and let set for 6-7 days or until clear.<br/> <br/> 8. Sanitize all equipment used for bottling and kegging and get your beer into its final container."

Boil extract, 1 lb of honey and 3 oz of hops in 2 gallons of water for 1 hour. Make sure the other gallons of water have been placed in the freezer to get the water very cold. If you are using a full boil and a wort cooler this will not be necessary. Add 3 oz hops and Irish moss the last 10 minutes. (If you do not have a wort cooler use the following steps) Place primary fermenter (30L Plastic with drain valve) in sink with ice around the sides and add 3-3 1/2 gallons of water. If your sink is not deep enough to cover half the fermenter use any type of container that will work. Pure in wort, straining if necessary. I use mesh bags for hops and moss, so straining is not necessary. The wort will be cooled to around 80-85 degrees by this process. Stir wort to bring the cold water from around the sides about every 5 minutes until wort has cooled to 70 degrees. Then aerate the wort. There are several methods for doing this. I use a pump for fish tanks. They are very cheap and work very well with an aerating stone. Always use an in line filter to make sure you do not get any unwanted germs into the wort. After aerating the wort for approximately 2 hours and pitch yeast. Put in place whatever type of airlock you prefer. I prefer a tube running into a bucket filled with water for primary fermentation. After 7 to 10 days drain wort from primary to secondary fermentor (6 gallon glass carboy). Bottle after 7 to 10 days using 8 oz of honey for priming."

Tasting notes from the original OMP:   Wonderful complex fruity, malty, hoppy (bitter, flavor, aroma), and alcohol palate. The Fuggles work great in this brew because they don't dominate it as some other aroma hops might.   Final notes: Chris Lyons mentions sucanut (succanut?) as providing that Old Peculier (OP) flavor. It may be worth a try in this recipe. Also, OP has little or no hop aroma, at least the OP I've tried here in the states.

So the starting gravity was 1.048, but finished at 1.020. As Conn Copas noted in HBD 909, it is thus possible to produce a relatively low alcohol beer which doesn't taste too weak.

"2",2,2,"Liberty Ale",7,"American IPA",21911,"extract","5-0","5 US gallons","About a month ago, I asked for suggestions on how to duplicate Liberty Ale. This recipe is based on Jim Busch's suggestions. Everyone who replied emphasized dry hopping and Cascade hops. This seems to have done the trick.   My best beer ever, and IMHO better than most beer available in the local store (cheaper too). I attribute the success of this beer entirely to the use of liquid yeast, or perhaps also merely to changing yeast. Previous brews were marred by a slight tang, which I eventually traced to the yeast (thank you Jack Schmidling). The American ale yeast made all the difference in the world. Everyone should at least try it, if only in the spirit of fun. After all, thats why I brew in the first place.   My next brew will be similar but I am aiming for an English bitter. I plan to use the same recipe, only more bittering hops, and subsituting Kent Goldings for the cascade.","5--1/2 pounds, light malt extract 1/2 pound, crystal malt 1--1/2 ounces, Fuggles hops plugs (60 minutes) 1 ounce, Cascade hops (30 minutes) 1--1/2 ounces, Cascade hops (added handful at a time over last","The brewing procedure was pretty much standard. Fermented from 1040 down to about 1010 in two weeks. I dry hopped it in the secondary for 1 1/2 weeks. Using only whole cascades (apart from the fuggles for bittering), really made a differance in flavour and aroma of the beer."

"463",463,463,"Summers Welcome Session IPA",7,"American IPA",9493,"all-grain","5-0","5.5 US gallons","This is the all grain version. I also just posted the extract version of this recipe under the same name.  First off is using a grain bill that has enough malt backbone to balance the hops, without creating too much alcohol. For this, I am relying on Maris Otter malt as the base, with a few pounds of Dark Munich malt. Maris Otter is bready, malty, rich, and used in a lot of English style ales. However, I feel like it will be an ideal base for this sessionable hoppy beer. Dark Munich adds yet more bread and malt, with nice aromatics that are almost honey-like. Rounding out the bill is a decent portion of crystal 60 malt for sweetness, body and head retention. Well try a mash temperature of 154F (for the all-grain version) that is a little on the high side for a more dextrinous, less fermentable wort that will add more body to the final beer. For yeast well keep things simple, using any of three similar neutral American Ale strains, though it has been suggested to use a less attenuative yeast, such as an English strain, to add body and complexity.  Now, onto the hops! In this recipe Im using first wort hopping, where hops are added before the wort is brought to a boil. This will hopefully mellow out the bitterness somewhat, paving the way for hop-bombing near the end of the boil and the nice aromatics that come from a blend of dry hops. I plan on dry hopping for only 4 days, in order to reduce contact time that can lead to grassy notes lingering on the tongue.","6 lbs. Maris Otter 2 lbs. Dark Munich (Munich II) 0.5 lb.

"750",750,750,"America Discovers Columbus",7,"American IPA",44278,"all-grain","4-0","5 US gallons","The purpose of this batch was two-fold - compare Wyeast's new #1272 American Ale to #1056 American Ale and try Columbus as a bittering, flavor and dry hop. This was inspired by all the talk of Columbus hops in IPA's (Rogue, Anderson Valley) and Delano Dugarm's recipe posted Nov. 28, 1995.   The departure from Delano's recipe was Columbus for the late and dry hop vs. Cascade.   They've been in the bottle for 5 weeks. The 1272 version is great all around - hop bitterness, flavor, and aroma. No grassy notes from dry hopping. I'd have to say the hoopla over Columbus is well justified. The 1056 version is just a little too harshly bitter. Could be due to it being a little drier (lower gravity) or the 1056 yeast is letting all the flavors come through unscathed. In any case it should improve as it ages longer.   I don't think the slightly different finishing gravities are entirely due to yeast strain. The 1056 was started from a fresh smack pack and probably a little healthier than the 1272, which was started from a 4 month old 20 ml tube of ""beer"". I typically add a fraction of a ml from a Wyeast pack to autoclaved wort in 20 ml screw top tubes and allow to ferment out before storing in the fridge. Not optimum yeast technique, but it works.","11 lb Schreier 2-row pale malt 1 lb DWC Munich 0.6 lb DWC CaraVienne 0.5 lb DWC Biscuit 0.5 lb Gambrinus Honey Malt 0.25 lb DWC carapils 1.5 ounce Columbus hop pellets (12.5% alpha, 60 minute boil) 1/2 ounce Columbus hops (15 minute boil) 1/4 ounce Cascade hops (4.1% alpha, 15 minute boil) 1/2 ounce Columbus (finish) 1/2 ounce Columbus (dry hop one week in primary) ale yeast (Wyeast 1272 or 1056---see notes)","Mashed at 157-155F for 65 min.

Tony helped me convert the recipe to a partial extract formulation. Here it is.   A taste of the primary at racking was rather bitter. Is this the style of an American ale of this type? How long might it be before some of this extra bitterness subsides? I like a hoppy brew but not extremely bitter. Tony suggests that the bitterness might be due to the very late addition of the Cascades.   Tony Babinec's Comments: Offline, Patrick reported that he found the beer to be ""bitter"" on racking. I wondered what the source of the perceived bitterness might be. The Perle addition should contribute more or less 30 IBUs of clean bitterness. The Cascades will only contribute to bitterness in a minor way, but ought to contribute their signature flavor and aroma. So, the total bitterness of the beer ought to be in the medium to high range. Note that the AHA American Pale Ale style guidelines call for high hop bitterness. Also, I think SNPA weighs in at about 32-36 IBUs. In the end, I don't see that the beer Patrick brewed could be over- bitter, and am wondering what he's tasting in the beer. In any event, the flavors should soften a bit with time. The challenge in an SNPA clone is balancing the hopping with that elusive delightful malt sweetness. Hopefully, the specialty grains help in this regard.","6.6# light unhopped malt extract 1/2# Cara-pils 1/2# caramel 1 oz. Perles (boil) 8.5 alpha 1/2 oz.

A brewer friend of mine had a 5oz pack of saazer plugs that he asked me to use (tough situation), so I brewed up the above recipe. I had just made an IPA of 1.060 gravity, so when this batch ended up at 1.063, I decided to continue my experiments with pre ferment dilution. I had already convinced myself prior to this that I could water down a batch considerably with no great impact on flavor, so I went for it here. I am using a counterflow pipeline to run my wort from the brewery to the conditioning room, so I merely hooked up the hot liquor tank to the counterflow pipeline and let 170F water enter the pipeline, chilling and rinsing the line somewhat. After topping up the fermenter, I added O2 and yeast.   Tasting: A good amber color, almost no detectable biscuit character, but this may change with more yeast dropping out. The goldings flavor comes through real well but not too strong. The finish of saazer and goldings adds a bit of complexity to the otherwise dominant saazer dry hopping. I had never dry hopped with saaz before, and it is a great change from the norm.   Malt notes: Despite the well known limitations of american 2 row malt, I use it without difficulty. The key is to tailor your recipe so that there are abundant flavoring malts/caramel malts to give the body/dextrins/color desired. By adjusting the munich and caramel malts, a very full bodied beer can be brewed with a terminal gravity as low as 1.008.","2 row american *breiss* base malt, target OG 1.063 (total) CaraVienna (DeWolf-Cosyns) 12% of grist Munich (DeWolf-Cosyns) 6% of grist Aromatic (DeWolf-Cosyns) 4% of grist Biscuit (DeWolf-Cosyns) Gypsum in mash US Whole Perle, ~8% alpha in Kettle-60 min Goldings Pellets ~5% 30 min Goldings Pellets 10 and 2 min Saazer Whole Plugs ~3% 2 min Saazer Whole Plugs ~3% dry hopped Dominion ale yeast","Add ~1 qt per lb hot water, gypsum and malt.

Three weeks ago I began an attempt at Anchor Liberty Ale (one of my all-time faves), which was also my first foray into the partial-mash world. It was extremely hard work, having never mashed before, and I was getting a little worried (apologies to Charlie) that it wouldn't come out. I got the base recipe off of the Cat's Meow, then consulted with some local homebrew club regulars to come up with some grain additions.   Medium color, about like Anchor Liberty, but not as ""orange"". More of a light red color, reminiscent of Bass Ale. Serious hop nose! The cascade smell jumps right out of the glass. Good initial bitterness, Cascade is very assertive on the pallate, and finishes with light orange notes and a hint of spice. Pleasant aftertaste, and no off flavors. Excellent mouth-feel, plenty of body. No alcohol hotness at all, though the feeling in my head tells me it's all there! If I make this one again, and I think I probably will, I might use less Cascades for dry hopping. I used nothing but hop pellets, but I think next time I'll try using plugs, at least in the secondary. I thought I was going to have a problem with particles in the beer from the hop pellets in the secondary, but they eventually sank to the bottom, and I just siphoned above them. The beer is perfectly clear.

Since it is such a fine beer I thought I would share my latest effort with the HBD. The latest was modified a tad due to material shortages---the changes shouldn't affect the results too much.   The original recipe used 1 ounce each of Willamette and Kent Goldings instead of the Chinook, and used Cascade instead of the Willamette in the second addition. Also, it used 12 ounces of 16L and 4 ounces of 70L crystal instead of the 36L stuff, above. The changes should yield the same color and bitterness. The aroma and body will be a bit different, but with all that dry hopping I doubt many will be able to tell the difference. With the above hopping levels this beer is not as bitter as, say, Grant's IPA---but then I don't like overly hopped beers (shields up)---yet it is bitter enough to make it an IPA and not just a random pale ale.","7 pounds, GWM pale malt 14 ounces, Carastan malt (36L) (Huge Baird) 1/2 ounce, chocolate malt 7--1/4 gallons water, treated with 1/2 ounce gypsum and pinch","Mash in with 8 quarts at 170F. for a target of 153-155.

For background, the recipe I was using was based on the IPA from","6 lbs Klages [I would boost this to 8+. --Ed.] 1 lb Crystal malt 1 lb light DME (due to low extraction rate) [...and drop this.] 1 oz Chocolate malt 1 oz Hallertauer 8.5% for boiling 1 oz Cascade 3% last 10 min of boil 1 tsp Irish Moss (last 15 min.. Didn't re-hydrate) 20 oz of starter. Wyeast #1028 (pack was over a year old and took 6 days","I used about 3 gallons of mash water making for a soupy mash. Boosted the temperature of the mash to 155 without any protein rest. I had used about 3 teaspoons of gypsum to get the mash down to a PH of about 5.0. <br/> <br/> Put in insulated box for 2 1/2 hours. Ending temp was 145. The requirement was for two hours, but getting the sparge water ready took longer than I wanted. Then I boosted to 168 degrees for mash-out. (iodine test showed complete conversion).<br/> <br/> For the sparge water, I used an 8% Phosporic acid solution to acidify 6 gallons of hot tap water. After 2 tsps, my PH strips looked like they were still above 6.0. Then, on the 3rd teaspoon, the PH abruptly changed, and the test strips remained yellow, indicating that it was now very acidic. I had to add about 3 more gallons of water before it got back up to about 5.0. <br/> <br/> I was expecting just a slow trickle for the sparge, but once I opened the spigot on my lauter tun, the wort hissed out. (Used the cylindrical cooler with sparge bag on SS vegetable strainer) It never did slow to a trickle as I was expecting. I slowed the flow of the output and input so that the sparge would take about an hour. (The water was 168 degrees, Re-circulated 1st runnings until clear) NOTE: I don't think the water was leaking thru the sides of the sparge bag, and it looked like it *was* filtering through the grain bed OK, which was always held in suspension. <br/> <br/> Collected about 8 gallons of wort (ph of the runnings never dropped below 5.8 even though the gravity dropped to about 1.010) and boiled for 90 minutes. A gravity reading before the boil showed only about 1.020 (granted, it was 8 gallons) prompting me to add 1 lb DME. I thought I had boiled down to 5 gallons, but was actually 6. (Haven't put any sort of volume markings in my Sankey keg boiler yet). Used a CF chiller, shook the 6 1/2 gal car-boy for about 5 minutes to oxygenate and pitched yeast. FG was only 1.032 at 60 deg F. <br/> <br/> No activity for 24 hours. After about 2 days, the krausen remained only about 2 inches (My weakest ferment ever). Since my first ""mostly-grain"" batch had a tremendous amount of gray gunk floating on top of the foam, I definitely wanted it to blow out of my car-boy which had about 6 inches of head space. So I added about 1 tsp *each* of Yeast nutrient, Yeast energizer, and Amylase enzyme to 180 degree water and then dumped it in. Also, I swirled the contents around in the carboy hoping to get the yeast more active. BTW, I have no idea what the nutrient and energizer consist of."

Bake 1 1/2 cups of the apple wood chips in the oven on a really high temperature for 20 minutes or so. They need to be pretty hot but not burned.

At the end throw in another oz of Columbus pellets.<br/> <br/> On the other batch I did the following:<br/> Scrape out all of the watermellon insides and, using huge spoons, press the hell out of big chunks of watermellon parts. The put all of the watermellon juice and pressed pulp into a huge bowl. Steep the grains for a while. Add the steeped grains to the pot, bring to a boil and add other malts. After a while add 3 oz. of Columbus for bittering. Towards the end add the Amarillo and the Liberty haphazardly for around 15 minutes. <br/> <br/> Cool them. Put them in your bucket. Add a vial of yeast that the guy at the local home brew store said would go good with these recepies. Ale yeast. Let them ferment for a few days. If I remember correctly I removed the wood chips but left the watermellon parts. Move them both to a carboy for a couple of weeks. Just before you bottle them, get a third bucket and just start pouring both beers back and forth and try to mix them up completely. Then bottle them. <br/> All I can say is that I wish I had more.

It was ready to go after 2.5-3 weeks in the bottle at room temperature.<br/> Now, you probably noticed we used Midnight Wheat in this beer, which is a seasonal malt from Briess (9/13/11 EDIT: This malt is now available year round! Go get some!) . If you are able to get your hands on some of this stuff; do it! Its an awesome malt. Your local homebrew shop might be able to order some in from their supplier from last years malting, and at the time of writing this articles there was still Midnight Wheat available at several popular online shops. If you dont want to go through the trouble of obtaining it, you can substitute in a darker Carafa for a similar flavor, or even a few ounces of Chocolate Wheat with Carafa."

In the 75 cl bottle, it is known as Cinq Cents. This crisp beer bears a light orange colour, and is the most hopped and driest of the three. Add sugar at the end of the boil - 15 minutes Named Cinq Cents in 75 cl (25.4 fl.oz.) bottles, this beer with its typical golden colour, its slightly hazy appearance and its fine head is especially characterised by its aroma which results from an agreeable combination of fresh hops and yeast. The beer's flavour, as sensed in the mouth, comes from the smell of hops: above all it is the fruity notes of muscat and raisins that give this beer a particularly attractive aroma. The aroma complements the touch of bitterness. There is no acidity, but an after-bitterness which melts in the mouth. This top fermented Trappist beer, refermented in the bottle, is not pasteurised. They denied they use wheat starch. They use wheat flour, between 10 and 15%, for head retention. This is a problem of translation, for the labels clearly state starch. Denis and Degraux say they would like to correct this but fear that if they change the labels they will be accused of further tinkering with the recipes. They are bemused by critics who accuse them of using candy sugar. It was phased out 40 years ago. Pure dextrose is used in the brewhouse while liquid invert sugar is used for secondary fermentation in bottle. Sugar accounts for 5% of the fermentable materials. As for malt extract, Dominque Denis picked up a large felt-tip pen and wrote in huge letters on a display board: ""0.1%"". He said the extract is added purely for colour adjustment as the main malts used, pale and caramalt, can vary slightly in colour. He said the brewery plans to buy caramalt to a better specification and will phase out malt extract. I sat in on the daily tasting of beers. We had samples of: Red (7% ABV), White (8% ABV) and Blue (9% ABV) that were two months old and were rich with malt, spicy, peppery hops, and earthy, berry fruits. 66% Malt, 22% Wheat Flour, 12% Dextrose Chimay's DominiqueDenis stated that the amount of wheat flour is in the range of 10% - 15%","14.1 oz - Rice Hulls (0.0 SRM) (Grain) 13 lbs 3.6 oz - Joe White Export Pilsner (2 Row) AU (1.8 SRM) (Grain) 1 lbs 1.6 oz - Wheat, Torrified (1.7 SRM) (Grain) 7.1 oz - Wheat Flour (3.0 SRM) (Grain) 3.5 oz - Crystal Malt - Barrett Burston (76.1 SRM) (Grain) 1 lbs 1.6 oz - Corn Sugar (Dextrose) (0.0 SRM) (Grain) 1.3 oz - Tettnang [4.5%] - Boil 75 min (Hops) 0.7 oz - Hallertauer Hersbrucker [4.0%] - Boil 75 min (Hops) 0.5 oz - Hallertauer Hersbrucker [4.0%] - Boil 15 min (Hops) 1 pkgs - Belgian Strong Ale (Wyeast Labs #1388) (Yeast) 0.4 oz - Saaz [4.0%] - Dry Hop 0 days (Hops)","0"

But, I need to add some calcium to avoid overextraction of tannins, as well as some sulfate and chloride to improve taste. Adjust as necessary for your water. With that out of the way: Bring about 9 gals of water to 172F or so and mash-in all the crushed grains plus the potassium bisulfite in your tun. I use a 5-gal round insulated Igloo water cooler. (One of these days, I'm going to get a 10-gal one.) Add what you think is the right amount of water to the grains in your tun. Starting temp on the mash should be 150-152F. Stir every 15 min until 1 hour has elapsed. Pull a thick 40% or so and slowly bring it to a boil, then boil 10 min. It should take about 40 min to do this. Return it to the tun, stirring, and mash another 30 min. It will be 158F after you add the decoction back. Mash-out at 170F then lauter and sparge to get about 7.5 gals. I usually sparge with about 3.5 gals and add enough of the remaining sparge water to bring the volume up to the desired amount. Bring it to a boil, add the Tettnanger bittering hops and pay attention until hot break occurs. For some reason, this recipe tends to boil over easily. Add the Glacier flavoring hops and Irish Moss after 40 min has passed. Also, drop in your immersion chiller and connect the hoses but don't turn it on yet. Put your strainer in the boil, to get it sterilized too. Add the Glacier aroma hops and the candi syrup after 55 min has passed since the boil started. Turn the flame off 5 minutes later (total boil time = 60 min). Turn on the chiller water and drop the wort temp to 70F. Dump the yeast starter into your sanitized primary, strain out the hops as you pour into your primary, then pour back and forth between the boiling pot and primary two or three times to aerate the wort. Lock it up and put the primary where it will stay in the low to mid 70's. Make sure you have headspace in your primary - if using a carboy, be sure to use a blow-off type of airlock because the fermenation will be vigorous. Move to a secondary when things are slowing down after a few days, or leave it in the primary until the yeast has mostly dropped out. Bottle with 6-7 oz corn sugar. Give it a month in the bottle."

"3",3,3,"Generic Ale",10,"American Pale Ale",12620,"all-grain","5-0","5 US gallons","As a born-again brewer, with a scientific bent and perhaps a wooden tongue, I decided that the best way to learn brewing was to start with the most basic recipe and process and find out just what basic beer, i.e. Generic Ale should taste like. Once I had that firmly established, I could then venture into other ""flavor elements"" using Generic Ale as a standard.   If that recipe produces a ""not tasty, thin, flavorless"" beer on the tongue of an expert, I certainly will not argue nor try to defend it other than to say that, that is what one gets when one uses those ingredients. That IS Generic Ale and it is my starting point for new adventures. Everytime I try something new, I have some GA as a standard to compare it with.   I might also add that I am glad that I am not expert enough to find it boring and tasteless.","9 pounds, 2--row Harrington malt Edme ale yeast 1 ounce, Chinook hops","Use standard mashing procedure.

I've subsequently made versions I liked better, although they weren't as true to the original. I substituted some dextrine malt for some pale (about 2 pounds), and use British caramel malt rather than (yuk) American. Problem is, it's richer and darker that way.   You can't really over-hop this beer, and my experience was that the dry-hopped beer reached its peak after about 4 weeks in the keg. Problem was that the beer usually ran out at about that point.

I wanted to do a straight-forward pale ale that wasn't too crazy. A nice, easy-drinking pale ale to sip by the pool. It's a nice light caramel color, good hop aroma that isn't overpowering, and a nice little bitter, citrus finish. I batch sparged this. I did 3.5 gallons to start, using 5.4 to balance out my reverse osmosis water. I then sparged with five gallons. I hit 5.5 gallons of wort after the boil, racked and dry-hopped for five days before bottling.","10 pounds Muntons 2-Row 1 pound Vienna 1 pound Honey 1 pound Crystal, 2L 1 oz. Nugget pellets - 60 minutes 1 oz. Saaz whole leaf - 15 minutes 1 oz. Saaz whole leaf -- dry hopped in secondary for five days 1 teaspoon Irish Moss - 15 minutes White Labs American Ale Yeast","This is a pretty straight-forward recipe. I started with about three quarters of the hops at 60 minutes, and every five minutes I would toss a few more pellets in until they were gone, about four additions. Hit it with the Saaz at 15 -- not too long on them, because they're delicate hops. Definitely want to dry hop with Saaz. The low alpha rate yields nice hop oils, which are great for aroma. Nice and spicy. Enjoy!"

I do batch sparging, so I verlauf until clear, then drain off the first running ( usually about 1.75 gal). Then add 2 gallons of 192 degree water, should hit 168 with no problem. Give mash a good stir then a brief rest before draining second running. Repeat batch sparging until you get 6.25 gallons of pre boil. Note: I have increased the efficiency dramatically by giving a 10 minute rest on each batch sparge, but would recommend just rinsing the grain without any rest. The end result of the higher efficiency is a bit heavy to drink, but if you're on a mission to get drunk, maybe you'd like it.<br/> <br/> 60 minute boil with the hop additions, rapidly chill to 76.

This beer came out pretty good and I would only change a couple things.   Beautiful deep golden color, chill haze, medium bodied, mild hop bitterness, very hoppy aroma and flavor (citrusy!), mild malty finish.   I presume the chill haze is to be expected with a single infusion of klages. A brief protein rest might ""clear"" this up, but I don't want to hurt the body. I would boost the bittering hops a little and slightly decrease the amount and duration of dry-hopping (maybe 0.5 oz for 1 weeks). I also plan to use gelatin for clarification in future batches. The big deficiency from my perspective is maltiness---maybe a half pound of aromatic would make things come alive a little. Any suggestions are welcome.   Note: I have already brewed pale #2 and, of course, I changed too many damned variables at once to determine the predominant influences. Oh well, I have the rest of my life to work out the details. I made some of the changes noted above, substituting toasted malt for aromatic (use what you have), and threw in a half pound of malted wheat just for fun. Mash-in stabilized at 125 F and I immediately heated to rest @ 140 F for 30 min, then on to 156 for 1 hour. Perhaps this brief stint in the protein-rest range will aid in clarification. I also made the classic mistake (read: adventure) of using a different yeast. I bought Wyeast 1084 Irish Ale for an oatmeal stout and then chickened out because I had no 6-row to aid sparging---couldn't let that precious yeast go to waste, so it ended up in pale ale #2. Any ideas what I will end up with here?

When your beer is done fermenting, you must rack it into a second sanitized vessel, preferably a glass carboy for which you have a fermentation lock. The beer and the hops are both added to that second vessel, and the beer is left from 1 to 3 weeks in the vessel. It isn't fermenting, but it's picking up flavors from the hops. If you don't want to do this, then instead of dry-hopping, add that last hop addition 2 minutes until end of boil. When you turn the flame off, let the beer sit with the lid on for 20 minutes before chilling it and racking it into the fermenter. But, I recommend that you try dry hopping sooner or later, as it adds flavor and aroma that is just right for this beer! English Pale Ale (previous recipe) also benefits from dry hopping."

The wheat is to serve the purpose of rice or corn in American beers and ""lighten"" both the color and the mouth-feel. Fortunately, malted wheat is not an adjunct according to the Reinheitsgebot and this is still an all-malt beer. (Sharon is of German descent and enforces the purity law) The Saaz hops give the beer a flavor that most educated beer palets will associate with a lager or pilsner beer, Ive found that the Saaz flavor needs some mellowing time. I also carbonate this beer a little more heavily than most ales (I add a cup or a cup and a quarter of corn sugar to 5 gallons at botteling time). Once again this is to imitate the heavily carbonated nature of American beers. Hope you enjoy it, please let me know how it turns out if you brew it.

Add pectinase and amylase per manufacture's directions. Chestnuts are really a fruit and the pectinase will create a much clearer end product by dissolving suspended pectins. Add water needed to fill brewing pot. Allow to soak 12-24 hours [24 is better] to obtain maximum enzyme action. During soak, raise and lower grain bag a couple times an hour when possible to get maximum sugar extraction. At the end of the soak you should have a brix of 4-5%. <br/> <br/> Remove the chip bag and allow to drain as much as possible back into pot. You will lose 3-4 quarts of fluid aborbed into chips. Add 5 pounds corn sugar and add water to bring volume back. The brix should be 11-12%.<br/> <br/> Bring wort to boil. Hops are up to brewer but I like Centinnials and Cascades. Add 2 ounces of hop in bag and boil for 30 minutes. Turn off heat and add 2 ounces of steeping hops for about 30 minutes or so. Chill wort as fast as possible with water coil cooler.<br/> <br/> Transfer to 6.5 gal carboy along with yeast and airlock.<br/> <br/> When fermentation is over, rack off into 2nd carboy along with fining agent.

(Optional: pour your wort slowly through sanitized stainer into the fermentor if you have a strainer). Fermentor should be filled to about 5 gallons now.<br/> <br/> 7. Take an OG reading with a sanitized hydrometer, should you own one. Record this value.<br/> <br/> 8. Oxygen must now be infused into the wort prior to yeast addition. Stir wort vigorously for up to five minutes with large sanitized spoon or stirring paddle. You may also pour wort back-and-forth between two seperate sanitized buckets.<br/> <br/> 9. Add room-temperature yeast to wort once the wort temperature has reached 72F to 75F. Stir yeast thoroughly into wort. Now place a lid on your primary fermentor (with fermentation lock filled and secured into lid)<br/> <br/> 10. Place fermentor in a dark room or area, where it's temperature can maintain a consistent 68F to 73F. Primary fermantation should begin within 18 to 36 hours of yeast introduction. Primary ferment will last between 5 to 7 days.<br/> <br/> 11. At between 5 to 7 days of primary fermentation, the wort may be transferred into a sanitized secondary fermentor. Be careful to avoid transferring trub (sediment) from the primary into the secondary. <br/> <br/> 12. Bottling: bring one cup of water to a moderate boil in a medium pot. Add 5 ounces of priming sugar and stir regularly. Remove from heat. Transfer your wort into a sanitized bottling bucket, avoiding any trub. Gently stir your priming sugar water thoroughly into the wort and begin filling your sanitized bottles to within an inch of their tops. Cap with oxygen barrier beer bottle caps and place in dark room/area at roughly 70F.<br/> <br/> 13. Conditioning: allow beer to carbonate for at least two weeks in bottles. This brew should be drinkabl after two weeks, though it will improve noteably if allowed to condition for one to two months. This ale is best if consumed within one year's time."

Full Sail was the most expensive beer on the menu, and I figured that at $2.75 a bottle I didn't have much to lose. Several others who were with me did the same, and were pleasantly surprized---Full Sail offers a reasonably complex (a hint of sweetness along with medium strong hops and a rich malty flavor) taste and aroma in a medium-bodied ale.   Since I first tasted this ale, I had to rely on others making trips to the Northwest to bring back six packs of this ale. A few months ago, I visited the Hood River Brewing Company in Hood River, Oregon. I was able to get enough information to experiment with a homebrew recipe for Full Sail Ale.

Two weeks after priming, I did a side-by-side with a bottle of Liberty Ale. The beers were of a similar clarity and hue, although Liberty Ale is slightly lighter in color. Liberty is also more aggressively carbonated, but the heads are similar. Liberty Ale is slightly more bitter, but, paradoxically, it also has a slightly maltier taste. (Incidentally, my Anchor Steam clone has the same difference in malt taste. I use M&F for it, too.) The Cascade aroma of the two beers is similar, but Liberty Ale has a more pronounced Cascade flavor, and definitely a more pronounced Cascade aftertaste. My beer is smoother and has more body. The brews are similar enough that if you served mine to someone who was expecting Liberty Ale, they probably would not be able to tell the difference, although a side-by-side comparison would reveal the imposter.

Well, I thought that this was the perfect opportunity to do a proper starter.

This foamed up nicely, & I pitched it in the wort on the actual brewing day, Saturday.   It's supposed to be a pale ale.

The fermentation has been very active (it slowed down on Monday night some), & the yeast on top looks healthy, but it's just not thick.

The FG turned out a little high, but it tasted a lot like Grant's. The major problem with this recipe was that the ingredients for five gallons cost more than a five-gallon keg of the original. Ammended Comments...Gravity Looks Off: I just copied the recipe from my 1989 brewers log without looking too closely. As several have pointed out, there seems to be way too much malt. Funny thing, that's the way I remember brewing it, because it was so expensive. Obviously, my gravity figures were off. It would have a much higher OG than 1.075.   Of course, I could have been drinking too much home brew and imagined the entire thing. But I didn't intend the post as a joke. Anyway, for your own peace of mind, try a lighter version and use one can of Edme and Alexanders instead of two.","Two 3.3 lb cans Edme SFX dark unhopped extract Two 4 lb cans Alexanders unhopped extract 3 lbs M&F dark dry extract 1 lb clover honey 1/2 lb chocolate malt 1/2 lb roasted barley 5 oz cascade hops (in boil for 60 minutes) 1 oz bullion hops (dry hopped for 3-4 days) Wyeast 1084 Irish ale yeast","Crush the specialty grains and do a partial mash. (We added them to two gallons of cold water, heated just to boiling, and strained.) Add the rest of the water, the extract, honey, and cascade hops and boil for 60 minutes. Cool and pitch yeast. After primary fermentation, rack to secondary and dry hop with the bullion hops."

In fact, I would hesistate to classify Moss Bay as an Imperial Stout, but that's neither here nor there.   Misc notes: I used hops that I had on hand at the time; I would recommend replacing the Tettnanger with Fuggles, perhaps, and also maybe the cascade with Kent Goldings. These swaps would make it a bit more true to style. Also, don't be surprised if your gravity is higher than that listed; my extraction rates are somewhat below average.","15 lbs.

The method of brewing herein follows the Thomas Hardy strong ale style of caramelizing a small portion of the wort and arriving at a very calculated specific OG. If you appreciate excellent strong ales and are not shy of a 5-6 hour recipe cycle, then you have found the finest, well-proven Barleywine recipe. (Note: Substitutions are not listed because they are not recommended.)","18 lbs British Pale 2-Row (Maris Otter) 1 lb Caramel (60L) 1 lb Victory Malt (25L) 2 oz Goldings hops (60 min) 1 oz Cascade hops (7 min) 1 tsp Irish moss 1 Tbsp Five Star 5.2","Unlike many recipes that seem to be a collection of leftover malts and remainder hops this Barleywine is very specific in its ingredient list, exact weights and method. It is not a difficult recipe but it is time consuming to do properly. First, we're after an OG of 1.104 and an ABV of 11.03%. Here we go!<br/> <br/> Bring 6.5 gallons of water just to a boil and dissolve in 1 Tbsp of Five Star 5.2 Ph stabilizer. Preheat your mash tun with 1 gallon of boiling water and drain it after 10 minutes. Always add grain to water, not the reverse. Calculate the grain temp and volume for a mash conversion at 148F. The strike temp will likely be in the range of 160F-168F, (but you must calculate this exactly). Convert for 60 minutes at 148F. Now calculate a second step infusion temp for at 152F by adding 1.75 gallons for 30 minutes. Drain 6.0 - 6.25 gallons of wort. Your OG at this stage will be about 1.080 - 1.085. Remove 2 gallons to a smaller stainless pot and gently boil-off 33% of the volume leaving 1.33 gallons. This will caramelize the wort as wll as increase the OG. Pour the 1.33 gallons of caramelized wort back into the main boil. <br/> <br/> This will be a 60 minute boil. Bring main wort pot to a boil. After first heat break add 2 oz fresh Nugget hops to a hops bag and boil for 60 minutes. At the last 20 minutes of the boil add Irish Moss. At the last 7 minutes add the Cascade hops, (in a hops bag). At boils end remove hops and squeeze wort as much as possible with a sterile spoon/spatula. You should have approximately 4.25 gallons of high gravity wort, (very close to 1.104). Cool wort quickly down to 65F-70F via coil or chill plate. Oxygenate wort well for 60-90 seconds using an oxygen kit and wand. Now comes a very important part unlike many fermentation methods. Do not pitch yeast. You will pitch the 4.25 gallons onto a yeast cake of US-05 of a previous fermentation or prepared culture not more than 7 days old. US-05 will complement the Barleywine's character and final gravity. After 5 days oxygenate again and make a prepared cream of one packet (11 grams), of Nottingham yeast and pitch again. Let ferment in primary for 9 additional days then decant to glass or stainless for secondary fermentation for 6 weeks. <br/> <br/> Priming to bottles required additional considerations. First, bottling will require less priming sugar. Use about half what you normally use, (22g DME/gal or 12g Dextrose/gal). Also, when preparing the priming sugar, cool to 75F and add 15-20 grams, (2-3 Tbsp), of live krausening yeast from your fermentation bucket. Slurry well the priming solution then decant from your secondary onto this slurry in the bottling bucket. Fill bottle to 1"" inch from the top on long-necks and cap with oxygen absorbing caps. <br/> <br/> This Barleywine is best after 12 months of bottled fermentation. It is creamy with a very subtle fruit finish and a rich, satisfying mouth-feel. The hops are perfectly balanced with the first run barley richness. I brew this twice yearly with great anticipation each time. It will yield only 4 cases so brew often and let me know if you have found a way to improve it."

As a variant, I scaled the recipe up to 2 gallons and collected and brewed the first runnings according to the posted recipe. I decided to sparge afterwards and collect what amounted to the second and third runnings together. Given the desirability of a 5-gallon batch size, I figured I'd add a little water and malt extract to the kettle to stretch the brew length up to 5 gallons. (No all-malt fixation here :-)   Summary: overall success!! As I suspected, I got more yield in the first runnings than predicted from Line's figures.

Pitch yeast at 58 F. Allow fermentation to rise to 62 F for the first three days. Raise temperature to 65 F for four more days. Then raise to 68 F to clean up any off flavors.

Keg and carbonate to 4 volumes CO2.<br/> <br/> This is a very simple recipe that relies on fermentation-derived flavors and proper mouth feel to achieve the best result. The step mash procedure I used was developed via trial and error over a number of batches. The ferulic acid rest increases the clove character of the beer, while the protein and the low saccharification-rest temp creates a highly fermentable wort with a creamy mouthfeel. Carbonating to 3.5 to 4 volumes is necessary for this beer to be true to style and enhances the mouthfeel and refreshing nature of the beer."

Mine is a little big, a lot more malty, a little under carbonated (though not much), and a tiny bit sweeter. Mine was similar in that it has just as much banana and clove aroma as the Brau-weisse and I got the hops just right.

SOAK IN HOT WATER FOR 15MINUTES (make sure you have the HEAT TURNED OFF or it can burn the grain, altering the final taste).<br/> <br/> After 15 minutes, squeeze out as much of the grain ""milk"" as you can, and discard the grain.<br/> <br/> TURN HEAT BACK ON and bring back to 155 DEGREES (or @ another 10 minutes).<br/> <br/> TURN HEAT OFF and ADD LIQUID MALT EXTRACT.

Then, put about a half gallon of ice water in the bottom of your fermenter bucket. Put the hot brew pot into the ice water in the sink, and add a little cool water or ice on top. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes. Then rack the wort into the fermenter bucket with a siphon and racking cane. If the wort is still hot, it will cool when it hits the ice in the bottom of the fermenter bucket. I then turn the sink's cold water on to a trickle, trickling into the hot wort as it is being siphoned out. This cools it down, AND brings the volume up to 5 or 6 gallons of wort. Take care not to oxidize your wort.<br/> <br/> ONCE THE WORT IS COOLED TO @ 75 degrees, add yeast. STIR. <br/> I ferment this beer between 72-74 degrees. <br/> <br/> With a Hefeweizen, a good rule of thumb for fermentations is this:<br/> the colder you ferment, the more spicy, clove tastes will come out - the warmer you ferment, the more fruit tastes. This yeast can ferment as cold as 63 degrees or as warm as 86 degrees. <br/> <br/> I usually make this recipe into 6 gallons of lighter beer.<br/> <br/> 5 days to ferment (primary)<br/> 5 days to clear (secondary).<br/> Once carbonated, it takes 2-3 weeks to ""age"" to the best taste.

It has a golden orange color and a nice tang to it. Enjoy.   1. I'm finding more and more uses for Cascades!  2. It's called ""cat claw"" wheat because of an incident that occurred while brewing. Both the cat and dog (65#shepard) are allowed to watch the brewing process but are not allowed to cross the line from the den into the workshop area. They normally are content to sit side by side and share the dooorway. For some unknown reason (this batch smelled particularly good??), a fight broke out and the dog bought a mean shot from the cat on the nose. I couldn't call it whining pooch wheat, could I??  3. Don't fear the high wheat to pale ratio as far as a stuck mash drain. I had no problem whatsoever and even had to slow the drain rate down so as to not sparge too quickly. (I use a 6' X 1/2"" slotted coil as my manifold).  4. EXTRACT BASED. I've made a good extract based wheat using the same proportion of hops/time schedule and 3.3 #'s of Northwestern Lq. Extract + 4 #'s of light DME (domestic-Red Bank Brewing).","15 pounds of wheat malt 10 pounds of pale 6-row malt 1.5 oz. of fresh '93 cascade whole hops 0.75 oz. of fresh '93 tettnanger whole hops 3/4 # Laaglander light DME Wyeast #3056","1. Make a starter with the 3/4 # of DME and 1 gallon of water. Boil down to 3/4 of a gallon and cool with an airlock in place. Pitch a _well puffed_ pack of 3056. Let this go for two days. <br/> <br/> 2. Preheat the mash chest with a quart or two of boiling water. Empty preheat water and mash in the grains with about 5 gallons of 140 F. to hit a protein rest around 122 F. After about ten minutes, withdraw 4 quarts of liquor from the bottom of the mash, bring to a boil, and add back to the mash. (This was to hold temp., you might not have to). <br/> <br/> 3. After another ten minutes (20 minutes total protein rest), use about 4-5 gallons of boiling water to hit around 155 F. Hold for 45 minutes. Additional boiling water can be used if necessary, but should be avoided if possible. (I like to hold the extra H20 for sparge if I can). You can also withdraw a gallon at a time, bring to a boil, and return it to the mash (2-3 times max.) to hold temp. (Yes, I know that I'm over the 1 qrt./#grain recommendation...) <br/> <br/> 4. Sparge right into the kettle using 7 gallons of 175 F. water. Go right to the boil (that's right, no mashout) and skim off the gray oily foam that comes to the top (subsides after 5-10 minutes). <br/> <br/> 5. Boil down to 13.5 gallons and add the cascades. Boil for 60 minutes. <br/> <br/> 6. Turn off heat and add the tettnanger. Let steep for about 15-20 minutes. Run through cooling unit to yield three four- gallon cuts to three 5 gallon fermenters. OG on my last run was 1.056. <br/> <br/> 7. Pitch 1 qrt. of well mixed starter to each fermenter. Ferment at 70 F. for 2-3 days, until things settle down. Lower temp to 67-68 and ferment for another 11-12 days (total 2 week ferment). I use the brewcap system (except for stouts!) and tap the yeast that settles. Final gravity should be around 1.015 to 1.018. <br/> <br/> 8. Siphon to keg, chill to 45 F. and C02 at 2.6 volumes (30 psi til it won't take any more, then go to about 17 psi). <br/> <br/> 9. Bottle and age for at least three weeks. It's good off the keg right at day 0 but improves mucho by day 21!"

Many of the Wallonian brews are way over-stated in the spice department IMHO, and that includes favourites like La Chouffe.

You may not need these additions. You should know your water analysis and act accordingly.) Grains should be crushed already. Mash in with 1.25 - 1.5 quart water per pound of grain to achieve 152F. Add the potassium bisulfite as you begin the dough-in. Mash 1 hour, stirring every 15 minutes. Then, pull a 40% thick decoction and slowly bring it to a boil, taking about 30 minutes to get it there, then boil it for 10 min.

Return to your tun, adding the finely ground black patent malt, let it settle 15 minutes, then lauter and sparge with about 3.5 gals of the water. Bring to a boil, and watch out prior to the break because this recipe boils over very easily. After hot break occurs, boil for 1 hour, making all the other ingredient additions per the times shown above.

This batch is the result of a several-year quest to replicate Sphinx Stout from Hart Brewing Co. of Kalama, WA. It was not influenced by the classic stouts which define the ""foreign-style"" or Export substyle (e.g. Guinness Export, or Tropical Guinness) but rather the stouts of the Pacific Northwest in the United States. Several of these stouts seem to share a common theme -- a heavy reliance on bitter, roasty notes to define the character of the beer. Sphinx Stout used to have these qualities, although it seems to have been toned down in the last couple of years. Now, I would say that Pike Place's Stout is one of the better examples of this ""style"". Over the course of several batches, I incrementially added more and more roasted barley to the grain bill until it reached the three pound figure presently in the recipe. When this beer won at the NHC, I decided that three pounds was enough.","9# Munton & Fison English Pale malted barley 3# roasted barley (unmalted) 1/2# English Crystal malt(40L) 1/2# Black Patent malt 2 oz East Kent Goldings hops (60 minutes) 2 tsp. Irish Moss (@30 minute mark) Wyeast 1084 (Irish Ale)","Mash in a single infusion at 155F for 60 minutes. The hops were, and always are, whole flower. This batch did not use a starter for the yeast, although I highly recommend using a one-pint starter for ales. My system is somewhat inefficient, so your extraction may be higher than my reported gravities. As I generally realize 26 points/pound, you should adjust the grain bill accordingly. <br/> <br/> Judges generally embraced this beer (although a couple were turned off by the large amount of roasted barley), but that has not prevented me from tweaking around the edges. While the above recipe served me throughout 1993, in 1994 I incorporated several suggestions from better judging sheets, resulting in New Stout III, which has remained unchanged since."

None of this is authenticated by any factual source that I know of.   I do not think you HAVE to use N2 to achieve the creamy head, but it would surely help. Otherwise, the longer the beer can be allowed to rest under CO2 at cool (serving) temperatures, the better the head. I keg and use forced carbonation. I will let the stout sit at serving temperature and under serving pressure for a minimum of 14 days before serving; it's better after 30 days. It seems to work!   The first (and perhaps most interesting) aspect of Guinness is that there appears to be more than one recipe! The stout served in Ireland is different from that sold in England and also from that exported to the US. I refer to these as the ""Irish Stout"", an ""English Stout"", and an ""Export Stout"". The priniple difference seems to have to do with the amount of sour mash flavor included in the brew. There could easily be other differences as well.   So when I brew my ""Guinness-a-like"", I also need to decide which one of these targets I am hoping to hit. I start with a basic stout recipe (see below) that makes what I call the ""English"" version; it has NO sour mash taste. Or start with whatever recipe you think comes closest and adjust from there. If I decide to make the ""Export"" or ""Irish"" version, I will sour the brew (after fermentation), with the ""Iish"" being the most sour.   As I understand, Guinness actually allows part of the mash to get ""infected"" with a lacto-baccilli (why can I not think how to spell this morning?). I did not want to fool around with that sort of thing (tough to control, lots of extra work, etc.), so I sour the beer by adding carefully controlled amounts of lactic acid after fermentation is complete. I add it to the keg as I rack from the secondary fermenter; if I were bottling, I would add it along with the priming sugar.   How much lactic acid? You'll have to be the judge of that for yourself as you decide how ""Irish"" versus how ""English"" you want your stout. The 5 gal-US batch I currently have on tap contains 40cc of an 88% solution of lactic acid; it is VERY sour. You might want to try half that and adjust according to your tastes.","11.0# pale malt 1.0# British crystal (60L) 0.5# black patent malt 0.5# roast barley 1.0oz Clusters hops (7.8%AA) (90 mins) 0.5oz Willamette (4.8%AA) (30 mins) 0.5oz EKG (5.2%AA) (30 mins) London British ale yeast 0-40cc lactic acid (88% solution) to finished beer (to taste)","Mash 90 mins; target 154F and pH=5.2; soft water!"

I tweaked around the edges of that beer by changing the crystal character a bit, adding some flaked barley to smooth out the head, and completely changing the hop schedule. I have also reduced the conversion temperature from 155 to 151. The new hopping plan adds more balancing bitterness to the beer while adding hop flavor and a hint of hop aroma.

"1906",1906,1906,"Pumpernickel Stout",72,"Foreign Extra Stout",4767,"all-grain","3-0","5 US gallons","There has been some interest in my ""Pumpernickel Stout"" that I mentioned several issues ago, so I will share the recipe. In checking my notes, I find that it was March, 1985 (not 12 years ago). I wanted to make oatmeal stout, and (remember, we didn't have many references back then in the dark ages) the best source I found was C.J.J. Berry's ""Home Brewed Stouts and Ales,"" 4th ed., 1970, on p. 81. It used 12 oz. rye, 6 oz. oatmeal, 8 oz. pale malt, 8 oz. black malt, 4 lb. sugar, 2 oz. hops, 2 t. brewing yeast and nutrient, 1/2 t. citric acid, and 4 gal (Imp., = 5 gal US) soft water. See what miserable information we had to make do with? I knew from Dave Line and experience that you couldn't mash all that grain with a half pound of pale malt, so I threw out everything except the oatmeal and rye, and made the following recipe. Since I am a professional baker, I used coarse rye meal, aka rye chop or pumpernickel meal, hence the name. It is the same consistency as or slightly finer than we aim for with our grist. You can get rye berries from a health food store or food coop, or even a feed and seed store (don't get mercury treated seed!).   This resulted in a fine, creamy rich, bitter stout (more bitter than oatmeal style, but I liked it). Over time, it became drier and overcarbonated, but was still fine. The home roasted malt gave a fine, fresh roast coffee-like aroma and taste. This is something I often do for dark beers, and it is worth it. I use an old steel stovetop popcorn popper that has a stirrer inside with a crank. You could also oven roast it. I like to use more of a lighter roasted grain for color and flavor, so I stop roasting before it is as dark as choc. malt.   If I were to do this today, I would not bother with two pale malts (I was probably worried about not enough enzymes in pale ale malt), and would use a good liquid yeast (not Irish for this style), perhaps a fruity one like YeastLab Australian 01. As a matter of fact, I think I will brew up a batch this next season. If anyone out there does, let me know how it turns out!","3/4 lb. medium ground rye berries 6 oz. quick oats 1 lb lager malt, home roasted to light brown (or substitute 1/2 lb choc.","I corona milled the grains. Cook the rye meal and oatmeal with 1 gal water 45 minutes, ad to 2-1/2 gal strike temp water and rest of grains to achieve mash temp of ~150^F. I believe I must have mashed higher, like 153, since I got (and would want) a dextrinous wort. I am surprised to see from my notes that I mashed for 3 hrs., longer than I do now. I do (and did) this by putting my kettle in the oven at 150^F. Sparged 7 gal, had a little trouble with it sticking, so I stirred and reset it; rye will do this, but roller milled malt should help), boiled 2 hrs to 5 gal. at 1.054 SG. Didn't note whether I boiled the hops all two hrs., probably just the last hr. Tetnanger for 10 min. steep after heat off. Counter current cooled, pitched with lots of (dry Red Star Ale) yeast from previous secondary fermenter. Open fermenter, skimmed, racked after three days, still quite active (beer filled air lock once). I continued to bubble a long time, until I finally just bottled 4 oz corn sugar a one month.

The sour mash leaves somewhat of a raunchy flavor to the brew, whereas simply adding to the boil a bottle or two of beer from a previous batch that has acquired a lactic infection produces a crisper, cleaner sourness.   How much to add is always subjective. To get you in the ballpark - if you can smell the soured beer a mile away, add 1-12 oz bottles in 5 gal. If you can actually drink it w/o throwing up, add 3 or 4 bottles. If you got lucky and the soured beer actually tastes funky-lambic-like sour, add a gallon.   The boil will kill anything in the sour beer, but make sure you clean the bottle up and anything outside the kettle that you may have splashed with the sour beer well before the boil ends.","8 lbs PILSNER malt 1 lb roasted barley 1 lb barley flakes 4 oz. black patent 1.75 oz GOLDINGS ~5% AA hop plugs 1-6 bottles of soured beer Wyeast 1084 Irish ale yeast starter","The whole idea is to keep the protein in the beer, so you start with Pilsner malt & don't do a protein rest. Mash using you favorite technique, but keep it short - 1hr or so. Sparge w 170 F water (acidified). Do not recirculate excessively. The short mash and the pilsner malt will help avoid a stuck runoff. Bring the wort to a boil as quickly as posssible. Normally I boil 30 min to coagulate the protein before I add hops, but i in this case, add the hops right at the start of the boil, or even before. Use Goldings. Add the soured beer - preferably soured from a lactic infection. Boil 1 hour, or 45 min if you used hop pellets instead of plugs. Cool & pitch Wyeast 1084 Irish ale yeast starter. SG should be 1.045-1.050 or so, unless you get spectacular extraction rates (I don't). Ferment 60-65F. <br/> <br/> Now if you bottle, use 3-4 oz corn sugar and let condiiton. If you keg, you've got an added element in how you imitate guinness: Chill the beer to 50F, & turn the pressure up to 10-15 PSI & Serve. Do not agitate the keg. The beer will have a head, but very little carbonation in the beer itself, just like guinness."

The resulting beer has the floral nose that is one of the chief characteristics of the #1968 yeast. Indeed, with the low hopping in a wheat beer, the yeast nose comes through very clearly. I would perhaps add a bit more late-addition hops, but my wife is very happy with the taste -- although she would prefer an increase in the carbonation. The color came out a touch darker than what I had hoped -- more of a dirty straw color -- but compared against a standard pilsener, it's not that much darker.   All in all, the Anglo-American Wheat is a nice summer beer that allows an assertive yeast to show its stuff.","5 lbs wheat malt 1 lb British pale ale malt 0.5 oz Cascade whole hops (alpha acid = 5.5%) 60 min 0.5 oz Cascade 10 min 0.5 oz Cascade steep Wyeast #1968 (London ESB)","Mash Schedule: 30 min protein rest at 125F<br/> 90 min mash at 145F <br/> <br/> I poured the cooled wort over the Wyeast #1968 London ESB yeast cake from a batch of pale ale and fermented at 60-65F.

This beer had the very same characteristics, tart with a hint of clove! I still beleive that the yeast plays the greatest role in producing this clove character, but I believe that the wheat plays a large role in this flavor than generally accepted in homebrew circles. One final note, a group of brewer's in my homebrew club did a not so scientific study of the affects of yeast. One yeast, EDME dry, produced a wheaty characteristic (though the beers brewed where not wheat beers).","8 lbs pale 6-row 3 lbs wheat 1 oz N.

As always, questions and/or suggestions for future attempts are welcome.   The biggest flaw of this brew is the lack of clarity -- I suspect this is due partly to the pectin of the fruit being ""set"" by the heat of the wort, and of course to the high percetnage of gross floating things that made it thru my racking tubing. If you're attached to crystal-clear beer, I guess you could try additives like Irish moss or PVP -- I don't know too much about their use, however.

To give credit where it is due, I based this recipe largely on an extract recipe that was printed in Barley Malt & Vine's (West Roxbury, Mass) store newsletter a few year's back.

OK, now there is some controversey over exactly WHEN to add the pumpkin: the original newsletter said to add 2 inch cubes of pumpkin to the brew-kettle 10 MINUTES before the end of the boil, and to ""ferment on"" the pumpkin cubes. In the batch I made for the Dixie Cup, I put the pumpkin cubes into the brew-kettle 30 minutes before the end of the boil. I'm not sure this was a good idea - I think I boiled off some pumpkin crud (""crud"" is a technical term) that got into the final product. With the batch I just brewed, I am going to add mashed-up pumpkin to the secondary carboy, and rack the contents of the primary on top of it. I used this method with excellent results on a raspberry wheat beer recently. I also used a very different hopping schedule in my most recent batch: 60 minutes - 3/4 oz Willamette (4.5% alpha) 30 minutes - 1/4 oz Willamette 1/2 oz Cascades (5.5% alpha) 5 minutes - 1 1/2 oz Cascades The original recipe said to add finings to clear.

I'm brewing a Pumpkin Ale for a Halloween Party, so I wanted to brew something palatable for the budmilloors drinkers, although my tastes tend toward darker, richer beers.   My comments: Took a lot of effort to keep all that water heating (I used the amounts suggested in TNCJHB) for the six hours or so the whole process took. Next time, I'm going to keep another cooler handy with boiled water and may raise my water heater temperature so that it takes less time to boil. I'm also amazed at all the crud/trub whatever.   I wound up with five and a half gallons in primary, but I must have two and a half gallons of sediment and it hasn't even started fermenting yet! I'm hoping the trub compacts a little bit more before I rack to secondary. I never had this much trub before, even on partial mash batches. I'm planning on adding Pumpkin Pie Spice (don't know how much yet) and hops when I rack to secondary on Friday night. I'll leave it all in secondary another 10 days or so and bottle. This was certainly a fun experience, but very time consuming. Anybody have any comments? Anyone have any idea if I'll get anything approaching five gallons when I'm done?

I spent the next 15 minutes or so, boiling more water and heating small amounts of the mash on the stove, so I could get starch conversion. After another 45 minutes I had full conversion, as per the iodine test and started sparging in a double bucket lauter tun system. I mixed the pumpkin in at this point, hoping the grain bed would filter out any pumpkin gook so I wouldnt wind up with a lot of pumpkin gook in the bottom of my fermenter. I sparged real slow, took me about 75 minutes. I went from there to boil, and I added all two ounces of cascade hops in the boil (advice from my brew shop owner). I kept the wort at a rapid boil for 60 minutes. I cooled using tubing submerged in iced water and siphoned into my fermenter. When the temp dropped to 80F, I pitched the yeast, hooked in my blow off tube and had a bottle of homebrew. My SG was 1.048 right about where I wanted it."

If you sterilised the berries right, there's not a trace of haze or cloudiness. It's almost like a raspberry champagne, and a great dessert beer. The initial taste is beery, and then a lingering fruity aftertaste. I used the pilsner kit for its relatively low hop content, allowing the fruitiness to come out a little more. <br/> <br/> (*) Sterilising the berries Because the berries are susceptible to wild yeast on the canes, it is advisable to sterilise the berries by heating them in water to a point a little below 85 degrees centigrade. (adding some dextrose to the water will start leeching out the flavor and color). Any higer, and you will release some pectin into the solution, which will cloud the beer (not critical, it just doens't look as cool as it does when it's crystal clear and bubbling)."

I spoke to a brewer there and he said they go for 15 IBU and use an apricot exctract. I decided to use fresh 'cots and go for a slightly higher IBU (my complete utilization is probably(!) less than the breweries'). I also wanted something a little nuttier and spicier.

If it's your first, learn from my mistake. The basis for this is just a simple Pale Ale and add some fruit. Here's my recipe for Raspberry Catastrophe (I'll explain the name below). I'm an extract brewer and proud of it. I can make some pretty good beer and I don't have the time for all grain.   I made a big mistake. My normal primary/bottling-bucket was in use, so I used a 5 gallon carboy as my primary. BIG MISTAKE. At least I was smart enough to use a blow off tube. The stuff chugged along nicely for a couple of days and then in about two days... Kablooey! Raspberries everywhere. I mean everywhere! I swore someone tipped over the fermenter and didn't bother to clean-up. I guess the sugars in the fruit took a few days to complex into something the yeast REALLY liked to eat. There was about 1.5 gallons of beer and raspberries on the floor and walls. I panicked, breaking the first rule of brewing: RDWHAHB. Once some brewing compatriots got me to relax. I immediately fitted the carboy with an airlock, boiled 0.5 lb of Laaglander DME (because I had it hanging around) in 1.5 gallons of water, cooled it, and added it to the brew.   My wife says it is the best beer I ever made. When I offered the beer to brewing gentiles, and told them what happened to the brew, they were skeptical. I said it's not like I scraped the raspberries off the floor and back into the beer. I was thinking of it. Raspberries are expensive when you buy them in November. Everything turned out fine. There was a slight wine quality to beer. Just a little tart. The longer it sat in the bottle the better the head and carbonation. If you can stand to wait about four weeks, it's great.

You don't need to go all-grain, but you do need to sanitize the fruit somehow. There are two main choices:   Add the fruit to the hot wort after the boil, when the temp has cooled to perhaps 170F, and keep the fruit/wort at 160-190F for at least 15 minutes to sanitize the fruit. If you let the temp get too high, or boil the fruit, then you will set the pectin in the fruit and get very hazy beer. This method works well for frozen fruit, which has generally been turned to mush by ice crystal formation. Sanitize the whole fruit with a food-grade sanitizing solution (perhaps by soaking in Everclear or 100-proof cheap vodka?), then add the fruit to the secondary and strain out during the priming/bottling process.

Hood 5 min<br/> <br/> Wyeast 2124 Bohemain Lager<br/> <br/> 1lb light DME for 1 gallon yeast starter<br/> <br/> <br/> I got an amazing 81% efficiency thanks to a long (2 hour) decoction-type mash with a lot of rests and a long (2 hour) sparge. A normal 60 min mash at 154 and a quick sparge at 170 would probably give you about 1.05, more appropriate for a Helles lager. I was not expecting such efficiency, it was mostly luck.<br/> <br/> <br/> My mash schedule looked like this: <br/> <br/> 20 minutes at 122<br/> <br/> Pull out 1.5 gallon liquor, boil then return<br/> <br/> 20 minutes at 133<br/> <br/> Pull out 1.5 gallon liquor, boil then return<br/> <br/> 20 minutes at 144<br/> <br/> Pull out 1.5 gallon liquor, boil then return<br/> <br/> 60 minutes at 155<br/> <br/> Drain and sparge at 170 in 3 batches (I did about 2-3 gal each batch) with a slow drip over 2 hours, 40 min per batch. Depending on the size of your lauter tun, just continue batch sparging until brew kettle is filled to desired volume (14 gallons).<br/> <br/> <br/> 60 minute boil. At flameout, I added 1 gallon of ice to drop temp to 180 then used wort chiller to 60.<br/> <br/> Pitch yeast and ferment in 45 degree lagering cave for 1 week (this particular batch didn't finish for 10 days, then rack to secondary, lager for 1 month, then bottle. Leave at room temp for one week then return to cold storage.<br/> <br/> <br/> Notes after primary: Primary fermentation took 10 days to subside. Very active for 6 days straight before a gradual slow-down. At first taste when racking to secondary, I received a strong floral hop aroma. A well-bodied mouthfeel with good initial bitterness and a clean pilsner flavor. Crisp finish with some floral hop notes. I am happy!<br/> <br/> <br/> Notes after bottle conditioning: This is the finest homebrew I have made. Finally, after more than a year I have something I am truly proud of! I drank one after a few days in the bottle, and this pilsner is clear without additives, crisp and smooth. The flavor is spot on for a pilsner, and the color is definitely ""sunny"" but I wouldn't exactly call it a Helles.

Add pectinase and amylase per manufacture's directions. Chestnuts are really a fruit and the pectinase will create a much clearer end product by dissolving suspended pectins. Add water needed to fill brewing pot. Allow to soak 12-24 hours [24 is better] to obtain maximum enzyme action. During soak, raise and lower grain bag a couple times an hour when possible to get maximum sugar extraction. At the end of the soak you should have a brix of 4-5%. Remove the chip bag and allow to drain as much as possible back into pot. You will lose 3-4 quarts of fluid absorbed into chips.<br/> Bring wort to boil, and primary fermentable sugars, return to boil and achieve hot break.<br/> Add hops and finings according to schedule.<br/> Chill wort until appropriate temperature to pitch yeast.<br/> Add 8 oz malto-dextrine when bottling, allow bottle conditioning for three weeks."
